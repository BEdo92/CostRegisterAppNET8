# Cost Register (.NET 8)

A simple cost management web app (with future plans for mobile support).

## **Features**

- Plan future expenses (e.g., if you're saving for a new TV).
- Calculate your **current balance**, with or without planned expenses.
- Visualize spending habits with **category-based percentage breakdowns** (e.g., food, household, sport, hobby).
- View and manage all recorded expenses, income, and planned purchases, with the option to delete entries.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Backend:** .NET 8 (C# 12) with Entity Framework Core
- **Frontend:** Angular 17
- **Database:** Azure SQL

## **About the Project**
This project was built with the help of a Udemy course, similar to my previous **SportApp** project and an earlier (2020) version of **Cost Register Web**.
